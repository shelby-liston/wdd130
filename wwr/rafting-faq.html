                <h2>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h2>
                <h3>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time; surprisingly, we deal with very few bored children of any age.</h3>

                <h2>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h2>
                <h3>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non-swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</h3>

                <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
                <h3>The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canvon is to be prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet Rain jacket and rain pants-do not bring ponchos-Quick dry shirts and shorts long sleeve cotton shirt and pants helps keep you cooler on hot days. Hat- large brim hat offers protection from the sun with a good quality strap. Sunglasses with strap socks- used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun. Sandals or water shoes- if not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked in before camper wear (bring something comfortable to wear around camp). Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs are all popular options. Water bottle, small day pack for hikes, moisturizing lotion, headlamp or flashlight, waterproof sunscreen, and lip balm are also reccomended.</h3>

                <h2>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h2>
