                <p>You're likely asking yourself: How much gas money will I save if I switch to a fuel-efficient vehicle? You're in the right place!</p>
            </section>
            <section class="gas-money">
                <p>Want to save gas money? The simple answer: purchase a fuel-efficient vehicle (or fuel-efficient vehicles). Not only are fuel-efficient vehicles sporty and fresh, but they are also money savers. Think about the last time you went to the gas station. How much did your tank of gas cost? Was it 20 dollars, 40 dollars, or even closer to 70 dollars? Yes, that's right! 70 dollars!! Think about other ways you could use that money you would have used on gas. How about that new phone you wanted or how about that new dog you wanted? Fuel-efficient vehicles make your wants more possible.</p>

                <p>As shown in this graph above, "Fuel Cost Price Spikes: CA vs. Rest of US," it visualizes the difference in gas prices in California and the rest of the United States. It is very clear that gas prices in California have spiked dramatically compared to the rest of the United States. According to AAA Gas Prices, California's gas prices are currently around $5.50 a gallon for regular gas, $5.90 a gallon for premium gas, and $6.40 a gallon for diesel. Utah gas prices, on the other hand, are currently around $4.10 a gallon for regular gas, $4.50 a gallon for premium gas, and $5.30 a gallon for diesel (AAA Gas Prices). Think about it you can save thousands, yes thousands, of dollars if you drive a fuel-efficient vehicle. According to ChooseEV, consumers can save around $2,850-3,400 a year on gas in California and thus, around $2,000-$2,700 a year on gas in Utah. Think about how much you can save if you drive a fuel-efficient vehicle for 5 years or even 10 years; that's a lot of money you can save.</p>
