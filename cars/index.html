                <p>Want to save gas money? The simple answer: purchase a fuel-efficient vehicle (or fuel-efficient vehicles). Not only are fuel-efficient vehicles sporty and fresh, but they are also money savers. Think about the last time you went to the gas station. How much did your tank of gas cost? Was it 20 dollars, 40 dollars, or even closer to 70 dollars? Yes, that's right! 70 dollars!! Think about other ways you could use that money you would have used on gas. How about that new phone you wanted or how about that new dog you wanted? Fuel-efficient vehicles make your wants more possible.</p>

                <p>Want to help our environment? Yes, that's right! Fuel-efficient vehicles not only help you save money, but it also helps our environment. Vehicles that use gas pollute our air and thus, make our air quality worse. Think about it.. the air we breathe is full of gas chemicals and pollution. In other words, this makes our air muskier and less clean. We are constantly breathing unsafe fumes and unsafe air. When there are more fuel-efficient vehicles in our environment, our air will become cleaner and safer.</p>

            <section class="car-options">
                <p>What are some fuel-efficient vehicle options? Two main options of fuel-efficient vehicles are fully electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles. Hybrid vehicles use both gas and electric. Some examples of fully electric vehicles are the Porsche Taycan, Polestar 2, and Tesla vehicles (Tesla Model S, Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model X, Tesla Model Y, Tesla Roadster, and Tesla Cybertruck). Some examples of hybrid vehicles are the Toyota Prius Prime, Lexus LC500h, and BMW 5 Series Hybrid. We're certain you'll find the perfect fuel-efficient vehicle you enjoy!</p>
