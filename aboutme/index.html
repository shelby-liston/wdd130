   <p>Hey everyone! My name is Shelby!<p>
   <p>My degree is Applied Technology and I'm so excited to start learning in this course! Some of my favorite things I love to do are online shopping, hanging out with my family and friends, and listening to music. I love that BYU-Idaho is flexible and can be completely online. I see various advantages to learning web design. I have always been passionate about technology; henceforth, I'm interested in seeing how websites are created and eventually, creating them myself. Personally, I am taking this course to learn more about technology and simply, for enjoyment.</p>
   <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my entire life and I've been loving it! My favorite quote said by President Russell M. Nelson is "Each day is a day of decision, and our decisions determine our destiny." </p>
   <p>I look forward to learning more about technology and web development throughout this course.</p>
